# Compressor

This project is an (unmaintained) proof of concept for doing glTF texture compression in a drag-and-drop interface.
Test it out here:  https://pushmatrix.github.io/compressor/

It is based off of Don McCurdy's glTF viewer: Web (https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/)

The code is real rough because it was a proof of concept and quickly thrown together. It is also several versions behind Don's viewer and doesn't support new extensions like KTX.


### Web

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
